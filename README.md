# 🔍 Fingerprint Denoising using Conditional GAN (U-Net + PatchGAN)

This project implements a **conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)** for fingerprint image denoising using a **U-Net generator** and a **PatchGAN discriminator**, inspired by the Pix2Pix architecture. The model learns to restore clean fingerprint images from their noisy versions using adversarial training.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

### 🎨 Generator – U-Net
The generator is a **U-Net**, an encoder-decoder network with skip connections. It preserves low-level spatial information via direct connections from encoder to decoder layers.

- **Encoder:** Sequential Conv2D → BatchNorm → LeakyReLU → Downsampling
- **Decoder:** Conv2DTranspose → BatchNorm → ReLU → Upsampling
- **Skip Connections:** Preserve fine details across layers

### 🛡️ Discriminator – PatchGAN
The discriminator is a **PatchGAN** classifier. Instead of classifying the whole image, it classifies **each N×N patch** as real or fake (usually 70×70), encouraging sharper and more localized realism.

- Stack of Conv2D → LeakyReLU layers
- Outputs a feature map of "real/fake" decisions for image patches

## 🎯 Objective

To train a GAN that learns:
- From: `(noisy fingerprint image)`
- To:   `(clean fingerprint image)`

The generator tries to denoise; the discriminator judges realism.  
Together, they optimize the balance between **realism and fidelity**.
